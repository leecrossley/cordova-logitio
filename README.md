Logit.io Cordova/Phonegap Plugin
=================================

This Cordova/PhoneGap Plugin provides apps with an interface to send debug information to a [Logit.io](http://logit.io/) endpoint.

[Logit.io](http://logit.io/) is [TODO]

Cordova/Phonegap 3.0 or greater is required.

# Installing

**Latest published version on npm (with Cordova CLI >= 5.0.0)**

```
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-logit
```

**Latest version from GitHub**

```
cordova plugin add https://github.com/logit-io/cordova-logitio.git
```

# Using the plugin

Once the plugin is installed, you do not need to reference any JavaScript, the Cordova plugin architecture will add the `logit` object to your root automatically.

You can then refer to the plugin from anywhere in your code as simply `logit`.

## Initialisation

Before you can use the plugin, you need to initialise it by passing it some setup options by calling the the `init()` function.
The first two parameters are required and the third is a bunch of options:

```
logit.init(uri, apiKey, options);
```

### init() parameters

- {String} uri - (required) URI of Logit.io endpoint.
- {String} apiKey - (required) your Logit.io API Key, which grants you app access to the endpoint.
- {Object} options - (optional) parameters with the following key names:
    - {Function} onSuccess - callback function to execute on successfully sending a message to Logit.io endpoint.
    - {Function} onError - callback function to execute on error when sending a message to Logit.io endpoint.
    - {Object} defaultDimensions - JSON object describing default dimensions to send with every message. For example, device/OS details, app version details, user details, etc.
    - {Boolean} logToConsole - if true, messages will be logged using window.console methods. Defaults to false.
    - {Integer} verbosity - a value corresponding to an entry in this.LOG_PRIORITIES which filters log messages if the priority value is greater than the verbosity value. Defaults to this.LOG_PRIORITIES.VERBOSE.
    - {Integer} maxQueueSize - maxiumum number of messages to store in the persistent queue. Once this value is reached, adding a message to the end of the queue will cause the first message at the start of the queue to be dropped. Defaults to 2000.
    - {Integer} sendInterval - Interval in ms at which to send messages queued in local storage. Defaults to 200ms.
    - {Boolean} disableSending - if true, sending of messages to remote Logit endpoint is disabled and messages are not added to send queue. This is useful for development phases when it's useful to use the plugin to log to the console but not to the remote endpoint. Defaults to false.

## Logging messages

The plugin provides the following logging functions, in order of decreasing priority:

- `logit.emergency(message, dimension);`
- `logit.error(message, dimension);`
- `logit.warn(message, dimension);`
- `logit.info(message, dimension);`
- `logit.log(message, dimension);`
- `logit.debug(message, dimension);`
- `logit.trace(message, dimension);`
- `logit.verbose(message, dimension);`

### Parameters

- {String} message - (required) the message to send
- {Object} dimensions - (optional) a list of custom dimensions in key/value form



## Additional functions

The plugin exposes the following additional functions:

- `logit.pauseSending();` Pauses sending of queued messages when online. Useful to conserve bandwith if you app is doing a bandwith-heavy operation. Note: if the number of queued messages reaches the configured maxQueueSize while sending is paused, each time a new message is added to the queue, the first message will be lost.
- `logit.resumeSending();` Resumes sending of queued messages when online.
- `logit.setVerbosity(verbosity);` Sets the current verbosity for logit messages.
    - {Mixed} verbosity - new verbosity value to set, either as an integer value of 0 to 7, of as the string name of the corresponding priority (case-insensitive), e.g. "error"
- `logit.getVerbosity();` Returns the current verbosity for logit messages.
- `logit.getPriorityName(priority);` Returns the string name of a log priority given the priority value. Returns null if a matching name is not found.
    - {Integer} priority - numerical priority value to find name for.
